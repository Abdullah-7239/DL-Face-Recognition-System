Check the necessary folder names present in 
the code.
The code works with teacher being recognized
first and then student will be given attendance.
Teacher will be given 3 seconds to come infront
of the camera and recognize themselves in
the system immediately following up students
can come one by one marking their attendance.

If no teacher is detected in those 3 seconds,
no attendance will be marked for any students.
