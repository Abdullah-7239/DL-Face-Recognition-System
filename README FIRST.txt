Check the necessary folder names present in 
the code.
The code works with teacher being recognized
first and then student will be given attendance.
Immediately following up the teacher, press
ENTER and students can come one by one marking
their attendance.
Once all students are done, Press ENTER again
to close the camera module

If no teacher is detected, no attendance will 
be marked for any students.
